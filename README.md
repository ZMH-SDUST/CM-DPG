# 📥 PhysScene dataset

## 📘 Experimental Manual

**We adopt the textbook “University Physics Experiments” published by China University of Mining and Technology Press, a widely used “13th Five-Year Plan” higher-education textbook in China.**

**The manual includes comprehensive descriptions of physics experiments:**

- 🧰 **Experimental instrument**
- 🎯 **Experimental purpose**
- 🧪 **Experimental content**
- ▶️ **Operational procedures**
- ⚠️ **Precautions and notes**

**The following figure shows the cover of the *University Physics Experiments* manual and a summary page of one representative experiment. These pages illustrate the structured descriptions—purposes, instruments, procedures, and operation flows—that serve as the foundation for the PhysScene dataset design and annotation.**

## 🎥 Collection Settings
- **To ensure high-quality and diverse visual data, we collected images across various laboratory environments with differences in angle, lighting, operator behavior, and experiment configurations.**
- **A multi-stage data cleaning pipeline was applied to remove blurry, obstructed, out-of-focus, and duplicated samples.**
- **The figure below provides a visual overview of these components.**
