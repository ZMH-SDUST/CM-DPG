## Experimental Manual
We are using "University Physics Experiments" published by China University of Mining and Technology Press, which is a textbook for the "13th Five-Year Plan" of higher education and has been widely used.
The manual details many experiments, including an introduction to the experiments, experimental purposes, content, operation steps, and tips.
